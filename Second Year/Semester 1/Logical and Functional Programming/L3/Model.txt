8. Write a function to determine the number of nodes on the level k from a n-tree represented as follows: 
(root list_nodes_subtree1 ... list_nodes_subtreen) 
Eg: tree is (a (b (c)) (d) (e (f))) and k=1 => 3 nodes

countNodesOnLevel(tree, levelCounter) = {
	1, if the root of the tree is an atom and levelCounter = 0
	sum(countNodesOnLevel(ti, level - 1)), i=1,n, where tree = root t1 t2 ...tn (ti - subtree i of the root) and levelCounter != 0 
}
